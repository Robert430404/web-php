    <h2 class="content-title">Contributing to PHP</h2>
    <div class="content-box">

        <p>
            Anybody who programs in PHP can be a contributing member of the community
            that develops and deploys it; the task of deploying PHP, documentation and
            associated websites is a never ending one. With every release, or release
            candidate comes a wave of work, which takes a lot of organization and
            co-ordination.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the introduction of release managers comes a smoother release process,
            but help is still needed: testing release candidates, finding and squashing
            bugs in tests, documentation, and sources.
        </p>

    <h3 class="content-header">Development of the PHP source</h3>

    <div class="content-box">
        <p>
            Someone hoping to become involved in the maintenance and development of
            the source should be experienced in all of the areas mentioned above, as
            this creates a strong team; everyone knows how every other part of the
            project works.
        </p>

        <p>
            You will also need experience in C programming as PHP is written entirely in C.
